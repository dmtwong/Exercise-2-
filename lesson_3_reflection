When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would like to use a remote repository when I would like to 
share the work,
require to collaborate on some task,
work while travelling. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It is becuase we would like to verify the recent changes on one side is exactly what we want before merging. 

forks is how we copy someone else remote repo to our github (but not to local yet); 
clones is from remote repo to local repo (& local to local)
branch happens in same local

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Having a copy of the last know state of the remote stored locally allow us to see how the wok diverge between colloabotor and I and manualy merge after review.
